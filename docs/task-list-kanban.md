# Kanban Implementation Task List (TDD) - REVISED

## 🎯 Objective
Add Kanban view for concurrent FSM visualization - patient records demo with multiple instances

## Phase 1: Visual Kanban Toggle & Template View
**Goal:** Toggle between diagram and Kanban view for active FSM template with all matching instances

### Scope
- Visual toggle button in UI (not keyboard shortcut)
- Show Kanban for currently selected template (e.g., "patient_records")
- Display all machine instances matching that template (patient_record_1, _2, _3, etc.)
- Column-based layout using individual states as columns (waiting_for_report, summarizing, fact_checking, ready, failed, shutdown)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket events

### Out of Scope (Phase 2)
- Keyboard shortcuts (K key)
- Drill-in/out functionality
- State group aggregation (use individual states first)
- Multi-template view
- Card drag-and-drop

## Initial Checklist
- [x] Patient records FSM created (`examples/patient_records/config/patient-records.yaml`)
- [x] States defined: waiting_for_report, summarizing, fact_checking, ready, failed, shutdown

## Phase 3: Concurrent Controller Pattern ⏭️ NEXT

**Goal:** Implement a controller FSM that spawns and manages multiple worker FSMs concurrently

### Architecture Pattern

```
concurrent-controller.yaml
  ├─ Reads jobs from database queue
  ├─ Spawns new FSM instance for each job (via start_fsm action)
  ├─ Monitors worker progress
  ├─ Loops back to queue checking
  └─ Idles 10s if queue empty

Workers (patient-records.yaml instances)
  ├─ Spawned dynamically by controller
  ├─ Process individual jobs
  ├─ Report completion to controller
  └─ Self-terminate when done
```

### Phase 3.1: 🔴 RED - TDD for start_fsm Action ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Create tests for a new `start_fsm` action that spawns FSM instances

#### Test Checklist

2. spawning_worker → launch worker FSM for job
3. Loop back to checking_queue for next job
4. idling → wait 10s when queue empty
5. error_handling → retry on spawn failures
```

**Phase 3.3 Complete!** Controller FSM ready for integration testing.

#### Controller State Machine Design
```yaml
# examples/patient_records/config/concurrent-controller.yaml
metadata:
  name: "Concurrent Patient Records Controller"
  machine_name: concurrent_controller

initial_state: checking_queue

transitions:
  # Check database queue for pending jobs
  - from: checking_queue
    to: spawning_worker
    event: job_found
  
  - from: checking_queue
    to: idling
    event: queue_empty
  
  # Spawn worker for job
  - from: spawning_worker
    to: checking_queue
    event: worker_started
  
  - from: spawning_worker
    to: error_handling
    event: spawn_failed
  
  # Idle when queue empty
  - from: idling
    to: checking_queue
    event: timeout(10)  # Wait 10 seconds
  
  # Error recovery
  - from: error_handling
    to: checking_queue
    event: retry

actions:
  checking_queue:
    - type: check_database_queue
      params:
        status: pending
        limit: 1
        machine_type: patient_records
        success: job_found
        no_jobs: queue_empty
  
  spawning_worker:
    - type: start_fsm
      params:
        yaml_path: "config/patient-records.yaml"
        machine_name: "patient_record_{job_id}"
        job_id: "{job_id}"
        success: worker_started
        error: spawn_failed
    
    - type: log
      message: "🚀 Spawned worker: patient_record_{job_id}"
      level: info
  
  idling:
    - type: log
      message: "😴 Queue empty, waiting 10 seconds..."
      level: info
  
  error_handling:
    - type: log
      message: "❌ Failed to spawn worker for job {job_id}"
      level: error
```

#### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create `examples/patient_records/config/concurrent-controller.yaml`
- [ ] Define states: `checking_queue`, `spawning_worker`, `idling`, `error_handling`
- [ ] Configure transitions with events
- [ ] Add `check_database_queue` action
- [ ] Add `start_fsm` action with dynamic machine naming
- [ ] Add timeout transition for idle state
- [ ] Add error recovery path

#### Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start controller
cd examples/patient_records
statemachine config/concurrent-controller.yaml --machine-name concurrent_controller

# Terminal 2: Add jobs to queue
statemachine-db add-job job001 --type patient_records
statemachine-db add-job job002 --type patient_records
statemachine-db add-job job003 --type patient_records

# Terminal 3: Monitor UI
open http://localhost:3001

# Expected behavior:
# - Controller checks queue
# - Spawns patient_record_job001, patient_record_job002, patient_record_job003
# - Kanban shows 3 workers processing
# - Controller idles when queue empty
# - Controller resumes when new jobs added
```

### Phase 3.4: 🔵 REFACTOR - Update run-demo.sh ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Refactor demo script to use controller pattern

#### Refactoring Checklist
- [x] Modify `examples/patient_records/run-demo.sh`
  - [x] Add `CONTROLLER_CONFIG` path variable
  - [x] Remove direct FSM spawning loop
  - [x] Add `populate_queue()` function - creates N jobs in database
  - [x] Add `start_controller()` function - launches single controller
  - [x] Update `cleanup()` to stop controller first, then workers
  - [x] Update `status()` to show controller + dynamically spawned workers
  - [x] Update `continuous_events()` to add jobs to queue
  - [x] Update help text to explain controller pattern
  - [x] Update main `start` command to use controller flow

#### Refactored Demo Flow ✅
```bash
# Old flow: Direct worker spawning
# for i in 1..N; do statemachine worker.yaml &; done

# New flow: Controller-based spawning
1. populate_queue() → Add N jobs to database
2. start_controller() → Launch concurrent-controller.yaml
3. Controller reads queue → spawns patient_record_{job_id} workers
4. Workers process jobs → controller returns to idle when done
```

#### Key Changes
- **populate_queue()**: Creates jobs in database with patient_records type
- **start_controller()**: Spawns single controller FSM instead of N workers
- **Status command**: Shows controller PID + active workers + queue status
- **Continuous mode**: Adds jobs to queue (controller spawns workers)
- **Help text**: Explains controller pattern architecture

**Phase 3.4 Complete!** Demo script refactored to controller pattern.

---

### Phase 3.5: 🧪 Integration Testing

#### New Demo Flow
```bash
# Old flow (Phase 1):
# for i in 1..N; do
#   statemachine patient-records.yaml --machine-name patient_record_$i &
# done

# New flow (Phase 3):
# 1. Populate queue with N jobs
populate_queue() {
    for i in $(seq 1 $MACHINE_COUNT); do
        statemachine-db add-job "job_$(printf '%03d' $i)" \
            --type patient_records \
            --payload "{\"report_id\": \"report_$i\"}"
    done
}

# 2. Start single controller (spawns workers as needed)
start_controller() {
    statemachine config/concurrent-controller.yaml \
        --machine-name concurrent_controller > "$LOG_DIR/controller.log" 2>&1 &
}

# 3. Controller reads queue and spawns workers dynamically
```

#### Updated run-demo.sh Structure
```bash
start_demo() {
    cleanup
    generate_diagrams
    start_monitoring
    start_ui_server
    
    # NEW: Populate job queue
    echo "📥 Populating job queue with $MACHINE_COUNT jobs..."
    populate_queue
    
    # NEW: Start controller (replaces worker loop)
    echo "🎮 Starting concurrent controller..."
    start_controller
    
    echo "📊 Demo running! Open http://localhost:3001"
}
```

### Phase 3.5: 🧪 Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Validate controller pattern works end-to-end

#### Test Scenarios
- [x] **Scenario 1: Empty Queue Handling** ✅
  - Start controller with empty queue
  - ✅ Controller enters idle state correctly
  - ✅ Logs show: "😴 Queue empty - waiting 10 seconds..."
  - ✅ timeout(10) transition working correctly

- [x] **Scenario 2: Batch Processing** ✅
  - Add 3 jobs to queue (job_001, job_002, job_003)
  - Start controller
  - ✅ Controller spawned 3 workers sequentially (PIDs: 98273, 98274, 98275)
  - ✅ All jobs retrieved from queue
  - ✅ Controller returned to idle after queue empty
  - ✅ Logs confirm: checking_queue → spawning_worker → checking_queue loop

- [x] **Scenario 3: Variable Interpolation Fix** ✅
  - Discovered issue: {job_id} not found in context
  - Root cause: check_database_queue stores in current_job.id
  - ✅ Enhanced StartFsmAction with nested variable support
  - ✅ Added test for {current_job.id} interpolation
  - ✅ Fixed concurrent-controller.yaml to use {current_job.id}
  - ✅ All 11 StartFsmAction tests passing

#### Integration Test Results ✅
```bash
# Test run output:
MACHINE_COUNT=3 ./run-demo.sh start
✅ Queue populated with 3 jobs
✅ Controller started (PID: 98268)
✅ Worker 1 spawned for job_001 (PID: 98273)
✅ Worker 2 spawned for job_002 (PID: 98274)
✅ Worker 3 spawned for job_003 (PID: 98275)
✅ Queue empty → controller idling
✅ Checking queue every 10 seconds
```

#### Issues Found & Fixed ✅
1. **Nested Variable Interpolation**
   - Problem: {job_id} not supported, needed {current_job.id}
   - Solution: Enhanced _interpolate_variables() with dot notation
   - Test: Added test_start_fsm_nested_variable_interpolation
   - Status: ✅ Fixed and tested

2. **Worker Naming**
   - Before: patient_record_{job_id} (literal, not interpolated)
   - After: patient_record_job_001, patient_record_job_002, etc.
   - Status: ✅ Working correctly

**Phase 3.5 Complete!** Controller pattern validated end-to-end with batch processing.

### Concurrent Controller Pattern

The concurrent controller pattern enables dynamic worker spawning based on
job queue depth. A single controller FSM monitors the database queue and
spawns worker FSM instances as needed.

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic scaling based on queue depth
- Centralized worker management
- Automatic idle when queue empty
- Easy to monitor and debug

**Usage:**
```bash
# Populate queue
for i in {1..10}; do
    statemachine-db add-job job_$i --type worker_type
done

# Start controller
statemachine concurrent-controller.yaml --machine-name controller

# Workers spawn automatically
# View in Kanban: http://localhost:3001 (press K)
```

## ✅ Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] `start_fsm` action implemented with full test coverage
- [ ] `concurrent-controller.yaml` manages worker lifecycle
- [ ] Demo script uses queue + controller pattern
- [ ] Kanban view shows dynamic worker spawning
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in Phase 1 Kanban functionality

## 🎯 Phase 3 Deliverables
- `src/statemachine_engine/actions/builtin/start_fsm_action.py` (new)
- `tests/actions/test_start_fsm_action.py` (new)
- `examples/patient_records/config/concurrent-controller.yaml` (new)
- `examples/patient_records/run-demo.sh` (refactored)
- `docs/concurrent-controller-pattern.md` (new)
- README updates
- All tests passing (unit + integration)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Inline view vs modal**: Using inline toggle for simpler UX
- **Template-scoped**: Show Kanban only for active template
- **Individual states as columns**: One column per state, not grouped
- **No keyboard shortcuts**: Visual button only in Phase 1
- **Read-only cards**: No interaction in Phase 1

### Architecture
```
app-modular.js
  ├─ DiagramManager (existing, shows FSM diagram)
  ├─ KanbanView (new, shows instance cards)
  └─ Toggle button switches between them

State Change Flow:
WebSocket → app-modular.js → {
  if diagram visible: DiagramManager.updateState()
  if kanban visible: KanbanView.updateCard()
}
```

### Data Flow
```
Template: "patient_records"
  ├─ Instances: [patient_record_1, patient_record_2, patient_record_3]
  ├─ States: [waiting_for_report, summarizing, fact_checking, ready, failed, shutdown]
  └─ Current States: [summarizing, fact_checking, ready]

Kanban Columns:
  waiting_for_report: []
  summarizing: [patient_record_1]
  fact_checking: [patient_record_2]
  ready: [patient_record_3]
  failed: []
  shutdown: []
```

## 🎮 Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle
```bash
# 1. Write tests (RED)
npm test  # Tests fail

# 2. Implement minimum code (GREEN)
npm test  # Tests pass

# 3. Refactor and polish (REFACTOR)
npm test  # Tests still pass

# 4. Integration test
MACHINE_COUNT=3 ./examples/patient_records/run-demo.sh start
open http://localhost:3001
# Click toggle, verify Kanban view

# 5. Cleanup
./examples/patient_records/run-demo.sh cleanup
```

### Commit Strategy
- Commit after each GREEN phase
- Commit after refactoring
- Tag release when Phase 1 complete
